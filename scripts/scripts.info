*because the HO5 parameters were added to the Nov 2018 FF, simply taking the merged.rtp file and placing under Jul 2017 FF causes errors.
Also, Jul 2017 only reflects fully protonated residues, which is fine for generating an intial pdb which is then porcessed further...
...Nv 2018 contains protonated and deprotonated residues:
protonated - AGHI, AGHM, AGHT
deprotonated -AGAI, AGAM, AGAT
