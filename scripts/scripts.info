*because the HO5 parameters were added to the Nov 2018 FF, simply taking the ffbonded.itp file and placing under Jul 2017 FF causes errors.
Jul 2017 only reflects fully protonated residues (which is fine for generating an intial pdb) but as I go on to selevtively deprotonate-> I then relabel the protonated residues (AGAI AGAM AGAT -> AGHI AGHM AGHT) this needs to be reflected in the merged.rtp by changing the residue names from AGAI AGAM AGAT -> AGHI AGHM AGHT.
In turn AGAI AGAM AGAT now represent deprotonated residues- which needs to be reflected in the rtp.

Essentially:
...Nov 2018 contains protonated and deprotonated residues:
protonated - AGHI, AGHM, AGHT
deprotonated -AGAI, AGAM, AGAT

**it might make more sense to rename the deprotonated residues, so that:
AGAI, AGAM, AGAT stay as is, representing protonated form
some other name representing deprotonated form
this way I don't need to use two FFs reflecting different rtps.
