1. Set HGB chain length (CL) in seqfile.seq
2. In doglycans.sh set CL based on step 1. Then bash doglycans.sh. Output are doglycan pdb files.
3. In pd2gmx.sh set CL based on step 1. Then bash pdb2gmx.sh, choosing option 1 for FF (JUL 17). Output is conf.pdb
4. In selective_HO5.sh under atoms_to_remove =() type in which residues need to have their hydrogen (HO5 in pdb) removed.
Choose option 2 for FF (Nov2018) Output is conf.pdb and a topol.top.
5.If you want to methylate a site, copy conf.pdb from step 4 to Methylate_pdb/ADD_Meth, then bash add_meth.sh. Make sure that the site you are
methylating has no protons (HO5) attached. Basically, account for this in step 4. Output is plus.pdb, cp across to working directory (../../)
6.In move_meth.sh set x=() which corresponds to the residues where a methyl group has been added, and set CL. Bash move_meth.sh.
Choose option 2 for FF (Nov 2018). Output is conf1.pdb and a topology.
