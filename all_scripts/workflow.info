1. seqfile.seq - set chain length

2. doglycans.sh - obtain a pdb

3. pdb2gmx.sh - modify pdb and protonate the whole chain (select jul FF, only want .pdb as output ignore topology)

4. selective_HO5.sh - selectively deporotonate chain (select nov FF), outputs a pdb and topology (with glinks included) -> ready to go if you don't require methylation

5. If methylation required:
* cp pdb from step 4 to ADD_METH folder
* add_meth.sh -> methylate residues, output is a plus.pdb
* cp plus.pdb back to working directory
* move_meth.sh - obtain pdb and topology (select nov FF), make sure you specify in script which residues have been methylated (x) and the chain legnth of HGB (CL) -> ready to go
