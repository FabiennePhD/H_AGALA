# How to generate basically everything via MAESTRo -> CGENFF -> cgenff_charmm2gmx.py
# NOTE: have a look at the penalties!

# Get MAESTRO Schrodinger. Needs an academic account. Free version for academic use

# Build the molecule of your choice
- Build
- Draw
- Tick the "Minimize" box
- Build (fun)
- Export structures (.mol2)

# CGenff (https://cgenff.paramchem.org/userAccount/userLogin.php)
- Upload the .mol2 file
- Copy/paste the .str file into <file>.str

# Convert the .str file via cgenff_charmm2gmx.py into GROMACS-friendly .itp files
# We need a CONDA environment (that's the easiest way...) to do that

# Create a conda environment from file
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate cgenff

# change the RESI entry into the .str and feed that RESname to the python script
python cgenff_charmm2gmx.py RESNAME <file>.mol2 <file>.str charmm36-jul2017.ff/
