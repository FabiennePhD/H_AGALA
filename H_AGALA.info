Converting doglycans .pdb

1.set chain length (cl) in seqfile.seq (the number straight after the curly bracket defines this)
2.set cl in doglycans.sh, then bash doglycans.sh
3.set cl in pdb2gmx.sh, then bash doglycans.sh
  Providing the merged.rtp file is in local directory along with the other files for the force field you should end up with topology. 

I have tested for various lenghts, I get a topology, although with longer chain lengths e.g. cl=100 I get warning messages about 'long bonds' ->might need to tweak formatting in pdb
